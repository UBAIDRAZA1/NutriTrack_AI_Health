# NutriTrack AI Chat – Frontend Only

This repo is now a single-folder frontend app built with React + Vite. Authentication and data storage use Firebase Auth and Firestore. No separate backend server is required.

## Run Locally

- Install deps: `cd frontend && npm install`
- From repo root: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview build: `npm run preview`

## Configuration

- Firebase config is set directly in `frontend/src/firebase.js`.
- If you use the photo analysis feature, set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `frontend/.env`.

## Notes

- The previous Node/Express backend has been removed.
- Firestore security rules live at `frontend/firestore.rules`."# NutriTrack_AI_Health"
